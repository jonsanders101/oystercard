# Oystercard

A domain modelled on Oystercards using Ruby to be ran on the command line.

This was a project I worked in week 2 of Makers Academy. It was produced entirely through pair programming; this particular repo has passed through several hands.

## Technologies Used
* Ruby
* RSpec - for testing
